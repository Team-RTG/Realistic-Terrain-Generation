/**
 * NOT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL

 * This is a complex class to achieve the goal of a HashMap where the objects are
 * held with weak references and so can be garbage collected
 *
 * IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
 * The Key class must be "keyable", meaning that two different objects with the same date
 * will return "equal" and will have the same hashvalue. Otherwise you'll never be able
 * to get the values out! The Java Number classes and String are all keyable, BTW.
