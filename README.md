# Realistic Terrain Generation Addon
This is a Addon for Realistic Terrain Generation (RTG) which is a Minecraft mod that adds a new world type which generates realistic terrain. It doesn't add new blocks. It doesn't add new mobs. It doesn't even add new biomes. It simply generates existing biomes (including those added by other mods) with more realistic-looking terrain.

# Downloads
 **RTG is currently in alpha**, which means that this is **On Hold**

# Credits
This mod is a re-branded fork of the revolutionary [Realistic World Gen](https://github.com/Ted80-Minecraft-Mods/Realistic-World-Gen) mod by [Ted80](https://github.com/Ted80-Minecraft-Mods). It was created as a new project because it will likely deviate from Ted80's original vision for RWG, and the author of this mod didn't want to interfere with that vision.
